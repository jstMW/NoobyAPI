# NoobyAPI

## What is it
or better to say what does it try to accomplish? I want to send buch of request to some applications and pass the results to some other applications, they might be on the samee LAN or not, doesn't matter.
This library should Allow you to 
- Send API request
- Receive Results
- Proccess them **by process I mean remove/modify some parameter based on a config file pass to it.**
- Pass the final result to the other endpoint
- Handle any error

## Is it the best solution? Why not use the other 1000 solutions?
I simply feel like an idiot using other ones tool. I want to gain a little bit of confedense and feel I accomplished something here.
Add a value ot the community!
